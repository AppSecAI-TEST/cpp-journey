# What is this repository about?

This repository is a collection of random programming problems and my solutions to them. I started my programming journey with C++, hence the name "cpp-journey".

My early code is not very good, but I'm still leaving it as I originally wrote it, in order to track my own progress.

Hopefully this will be helpful to someone. I will keep adding new problems and solutions as I try out more programming languages and solve more challenges.
