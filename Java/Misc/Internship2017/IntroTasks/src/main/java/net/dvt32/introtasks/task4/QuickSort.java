	/**
	 * This method sorts (in ascending order) an integer array recursively by using QuickSort.
	 * 
	 * The divide-and-conquer strategy is used in QuickSort. Below the recursion step is described:
	 * 
	 * - 1. Choose a pivot value. 
	 * 		We take the value of the middle element as pivot value, 
	 * 		but it can be any value, which is in range of sorted values, 
	 * 		even if it doesn't present in the array.
	 * 
	 * - 2. Partition. 
	 * 		Rearrange elements in such a way, that all elements 
	 * 		which are lesser than the pivot go to the left part of the array 
	 * 		and all elements greater than the pivot, go to the right part of the array. 
	 * 		Values equal to the pivot can stay in any part of the array. 
	 * 		Notice, that array may be divided in non-equal parts.
	 * 
	 * - 3. Sort both parts. 
	 * 		Apply quicksort algorithm recursively to the left and the right parts.
	 * 
	 * Partition algorithm in detail:
	 * 
	 * There are two indices i and j and at the very beginning of the partition algorithm 
	 * i points to the first element in the array and j points to the last one. 
	 * 
	 * Then algorithm moves i forward, until an element with value greater or equal to the pivot is found. 
	 * Index j is moved backward, until an element with value lesser or equal to the pivot is found. 
	 * 
	 * If i â‰¤ j then they are swapped and i steps to the next position (i + 1), 
	 * j steps to the previous one (j - 1). 
	 * 
	 * Algorithm stops, when i becomes greater than j.
	 * 
	 * After partition, all values before i-th element are less or equal than the pivot 
	 * and all values after j-th element are greater or equal to the pivot.
	 * 
	 * @param arr The input integer array, which is to be sorted.
	 * @param L First valid index of the array (0)
	 * @param R	Last valid index of the array (arr.length-1)
